# HAN_PROG5

PROG5 and PROG5-LAB: Software Design with UML and C++

Lab assignments P1:
* 1 Make a basic stepper motor library and submit it to GitHub classroom
* 2 Create a UML Use Case diagram with description (see Markdown document) for a sensor application
* 3 Create a library for a sensor (bring your own or use BMP280) in Arduino in C++
* 4 Create a library for an i2c sensor or function on a Raspberry Pi in C++
* 5 Extend the Pi sensor Library to connect and publish to an MQTT broker in C++
* 6 Create a UML class diagram and sequence diagram for your sensor library
* 7 Perform Unit test on your Pi sensor library in C++
* 8 Check your sensor library on DRY, KISS, SOLID and Loose Coupling / Strong Cohesion principles, refactor your code and report which principles you improved on.

My own experiences of the assignments:
* OPDRACHT 1: Contacted Johan, Due to this being an introduction to git, this assignment was not needed.
* OPDRACHT 2: In PLANTUML i wrote a basic use case diagram for my BME280 library code, file name usecasediagram.txt

* OPDRACHT 3: I wrote a library for the bosch BME280 sensor, it works with the Wire library to handle i2c commands.
Written the library based on my work from last year.
* OPDRACHT 4: I ported the Arduino library to the raspberry pi. Porting my own library was not hard, but porting the i2c library was harder.
* OPDRACHT 5: I added MQTT support with some help from the internet. i needed to compile a github mqtt c++ library for the raspberry pi because there is no support at first.
Used my own MQTT server for testing 
commands for running:
--> g++ main.cpp bme280.cpp i2c.cpp -o bme280_mqtt -lpaho-mqttpp3 -lpaho-mqtt3as -pthread
--> sudo ./bme280_mqtt
* OPDRACHT 6: Since i modulairly programmed the code in the last assignments i could easily Generate an PLANTUML class and sequence diagram semi-automatically. It uses the right functions and connections and shows great patterns

* Sequence Diagram

* OPDRACHT 7: I made an very basic unit test of the BME280 sensor, to confirm if the sensor behaviour actually works.
* Possible to apply in an eviromental chamber together with an calibrated meter to confirm the exact readings.

* Unit test of functions of the sensor
